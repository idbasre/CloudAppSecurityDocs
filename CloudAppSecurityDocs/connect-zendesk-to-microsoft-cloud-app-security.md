# Connect Zendesk to Microsoft Cloud App Security (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

This article provides instructions for connecting Microsoft Cloud App Security to your existing Zendesk using the App Connector APIs. This connection gives you visibility into and control over your organization's Zendesk use.

## Prerequisites

- The Zendesk user used for logging into Zendesk must be an admin.
- Supported Zendesk licenses:
  - Enterprise
  - Enterprise Plus
 
 >[!NOTE]
> Connecting Zendesk to Cloud App Security with a Zendesk user that is not an admin will result in a connection error.

1. In the next screen, enter the following fields:

    - **Client ID**: the Unique identifier you used when you created the OAuth app in the Zendesk admin portal.
    - **Client Secret**: your saved secret.
    - **Client endpoint**: Zendesk URL. It should be `<account_name>.zendesk.com`.

1. Select **Connect in Zendesk**.
1. Make sure the connection succeeded by selecting **Test now**. Testing may take a few minutes. After receiving a success notice, select **Close**.
1. The first connection can take up to four hours to get all users and their activities in the seven days before the connection.
1. After the connectorâ€™s **Status** is marked as **Connected**, the connector is live and works.
